Welcome to the Country Searcher Application, written by Stephan Ellenberger.

### How to run the application

If you'd like to compile your own version of this application, you can do so with:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

However, the program is already compiled for you, and all you need to do to run it is, so use the command below:

```bash
java -cp target/accenture_tech_test_2023-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.countries.Main 
```
